This is a project that includes database and data visualization. Use PstSQL to operate the database and visualize it in Tableau. The original data is stored in a txt file, and the filtered data is stored in a csv file. Finally, the dashboard is presented in a twb file. The data are all virtual.
To see the whole Dashiboard, open Immunization Dashboard.twb and connect Data Source to Flu Demo Data.csv file.

Here are some Screenshots of the Dashboard.
